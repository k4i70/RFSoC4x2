This folder contains everything I have right now, including all your old files Joe. 

See `Example_PythonCode/SyncDualOutput.ipynb` for the double square wave generation code. I think that should work? I kinda don't know but I included the bitstream files so it should be ready to test. 
- But again, not sure if it'll work?
