This folder contains everything I have right now, including old files in the Box drive. 

See `Example_PythonCode/SyncDualOutput.ipynb` for the double square wave generation code. I think that should work? I'm not positive but I included the bitstream files so it should be ready to test. 
- This was also all AI, but I simulated it to make sure the waveform images look right, but no way to test it on hardware.
